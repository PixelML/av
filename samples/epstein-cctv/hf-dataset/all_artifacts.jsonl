Notable moments include heightened activity involving access control, supervision, and the brief presence of security personnel or individuals in tactical gear. The overall scene involves routine administrative, supervisory, and access-related behaviors, with occasional object carrying, communication device use, and shifts in area occupancy.\n\n---\n\n## Categories\n\n- person_entry\n- person_exit\n- group_movement\n- door_interaction\n- desk_area\n- counter_interaction\n- supervision\n- escorting\n- device_use (phone/radio)\n- security_presence\n- equipment_use (object/bag carrying)\n- workstation\n- area_movement\n- access_control\n- area_vacancy\n- multi-person_interaction"}
