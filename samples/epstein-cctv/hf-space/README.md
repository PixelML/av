# Epstein Files CCTV — Video Memory Search

Search 472 AI-generated temporal event captions + 21 structured summaries & analysis reports from DOJ Epstein Files Dataset 8 (MCC prison CCTV surveillance footage).

GPT-4.1 vision analyzed 30-second video chunks to describe *what happens across frames* — temporal changes, people entering/leaving, door activity. Static scenes are filtered out.

Built with [`av`](https://github.com/PixelML/av) — video memory for AI agents.

## How it works

1. 25 CCTV clips from MCC New York (July–August 2019) were ingested with `av ingest --captions --topic security`
2. Three-layer cascade: chunk VLM (GPT-4.1 vision) → structured event log → analysis report
3. 472 temporal event captions + 21 summaries + 21 reports indexed with SQLite FTS5
4. This Space lets you search those captions with natural language
